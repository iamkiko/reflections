When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When the work is being shared with other team members, so we can collaborate.
    When I need to access the work from another computer.
    When I need to get feedback from other members of the team or public and it's in a publically accessable place

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I might be working on my own version of the project or a side chain in which the auto pull is not necessary. This is even more evident if someone else is working on the same project and we don't want to conflate our work prematurely as we are experimenting.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: cloning from github to github -> only used in github context
    Branches: used on a single repository
    Clone: taking an existing repo and making one exactly the same
